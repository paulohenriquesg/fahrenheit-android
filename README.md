# fahrenheit-android

Yet another Audiobookshelf client, this time focusing on the Fire Stick (and maybe other Android devices).

I know I can cast from other apps. And I know I can use the web interface. 

The "issue" is that both options don't provide, IMHO, a good experience.

## Inspiration for the name

Although I haven't read (so far! It's on my reading list) **Fahrenheit 451**, I could not think of a more connected name when talking about books and a Fire Stick. 

## Disclaimer

The intention (so far) is to create a client for the Audiobookshelf API. 

No admin features are planned.

And, to be clear I'm not affiliated with Audiobookshelf in any way.
